# NewsDolphin - Stay Updated:

This project is created using **React** that utilizes **News APIs** to retrieve and display the latest news from around the country for the user. The project also utilizes **Bootstrap** for CSS components, including cards, buttons, and flex properties.

# User-Interactive Project:

This project allows for **user interaction**. The navbar offers multiple **categories** for users to select based on their interests. The news will load with an **infinity scroll** feature.

# Cannot deploy: 

I am using **APIs for developers** which comes with the free plan. Deployment of these websites which uses the fetch function can be done using the "business plan" for APIs.
